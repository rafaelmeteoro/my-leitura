# MyLeitura Project

Final assessment project for Udacity's React and Redux course.

## Usage
Before you begin, this project needs a client server. The api-server was provided by udacity at a [github starter project](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
